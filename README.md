#  :dart: Install Instructions  :dart:

Uses pouch-db. If you do not have pouch-db installed, run "npm install -g pouchdb-server". 
  (https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server for usage)


## Clone this repository:
  git clone https://github.com/oliverdain/darts.git

## Navigate to newly created directory.
 
cd darts

## Install node dependencies.

npm install

(Windows users may encounter "node-gyp rebuild" errors. If this happens, I *strongly* recommend running in a Linux virtual machine instead of wasting time debugging node-gyp in Windows.)

## Start the app (have pouchdb running) 
node app.js

Open [localhost port 3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Sample deploy:
